2. Making various visualizations enhances our understanding of student performance
data. In topics like math, reading, and writing, a bar chart that compares average
scores by gender indicates whether one gender does better than the other. Finding
out which subjects students struggle with the most is made easier with the use of a
line chart that tracks scores across subjects. How many students take extra
preparation seriously can be seen via a pie chart that displays test preparation
course completion rates. The question of whether studying more truly improves
performance is answered by a scatter plot that compares study hours to maths
scores. Last but not least, a box plot showing the distribution of scores
according to parental education level aids in figuring out whether or not pupils
who have parents with higher levels of education typically perform better. Finding
patterns, comparing groups, and examining links in the data are all made simpler by
these visualizations.
